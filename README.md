# Journeys

## Introduction

A Julia implementation of the coding problem [found
here](https://github.com/mikehadlow/Journeys), which I initially found [via
Kim Richmond](https://github.com/Lethrir/Journeys).

Please note that this isn't quite finished yet, and this is also only the
second body of Julia code I've ever written. Don't read this as an example
idiomatic Julia code. Don't read it as any sort of example of Julia code.
This is a learning exercise for me.

## Running

Assuming you have [Julia](https://julialang.org/) installed, it should just
be a case of running the `journeys` command contained in this directory (on
Unix-like systems anyway)
